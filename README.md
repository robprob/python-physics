# Physics Problem Solutions

Worked solutions and notes for problems from *Physics Problems and How to Solve Them* by Clarence E. Bennett, organized in Jupyter notebooks.

## Why
Iâ€™m using this repository to deepen my understanding of physics by actively solving and coding the problems. Writing out calculations in notebooks helps me maintain a record of progress as I work throught the book, build stronger intuition, and practice clear and reproducible computational problem-solving methods.
